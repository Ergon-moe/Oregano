# Verifying Oregano Downloads using File Hashes
PLEASE NOTE: sha256sum is known as gsha256sum in MACOS

1. Download the SHA256SUMS file to the same directory as the installer. 


    cd Downloads

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oregano/keys-n-hashes/master/sigs-and-sums/3.1/mac/SHA256.Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg.txt

Compare the file hashes

    sha256sum -c SHA256.Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg.txt 2>&1
    
If the file hashes match, "OK" will be displayed on your screen. 

    Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg: OK
    
If the hashes do not match, then there was a problem with either the download or a problem with the server. You should download the file again.

## Manual Verification of File Hashes

Download the SHA256SUMS files

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oregano/keys-n-hashes/master/sigs-and-sums/3.1/mac/SHA256.Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg.txt
    
View the SHA256SUMS file

    cat SHA256.Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg.txt
    670d6851908720195d58a1d94a53e77e4120e0e98f6940ee93a76f4468e2c6c5  Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg
    
Generate a SHA256 hash of the file you downloaded

    sha256sum Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg
    670d6851908720195d58a1d94a53e77e4120e0e98f6940ee93a76f4468e2c6c5  Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg
    
Now compare the hash that your machine calculated with the corresponding hash in the SHA256SUMS file.

When both hashes match exactly then the downloaded file is almost certainly intact. 

# Verifying Oregano Downloads using GNU Privacy Guard

## TLDR

    gpg --verify <SIGNATURE> <FILE>

## Detailed Steps
1. Create your private key with

        gpg --generate-key

    Choose RSA/DSA key with 4096 bits. 
    Enter your name, email and make sure to choose a strong password.

2. Download the public key of the person/institution you want to verify. For TrueCrypt, their public key is available here.

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oregano/keys-n-hashes/master/pubkeys/calinkey.txt

3. Import the person’s public key into your key ring

        gpg --import TrueCrypt-Foundation-Public-Key.asc
        
    You should see output similar to
    
        gpg: key 21810A542031C02C: public key "Calin Culianu (NilacTheGrim)         <calin.culianu@gmail.com>" imported
        gpg: Total number processed: 1
        gpg:               imported: 1

4. You need to sign the person’s public key with your private key, to tell GPG that you “accept” the key. 

        gpg --list-keys

        pub   dsa2048 2017-08-20 [SC]
        D465135F97D0047E18E99DC321810A542031C02C
        uid           [ unknown] Calin Culianu (NilacTheGrim) <calin.culianu@gmail.com>
        sub   elg2048 2017-08-20 [E]

    The “name” of their key is long string on the second line.

5. Sign their public key with:

        gpg --sign-key D465135F97D0047E18E99DC321810A542031C02C

6. Download the corresponding signature file

        wget https://github.com/Oregano/keys-n-hashes/raw/master/sigs-and-sums/3.1/mac/Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg.sig
        
7. Now you can verify the signature of the file you downloaded

        gpg --verify Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg.sig
      
    Example of successful output
    
        gpg: assuming signed data in 'Oregano-3.1-macosx.dmg'
        gpg: Signature made Sat  6 Jan 03:51:06 2018 AEDT
        gpg:                using DSA key 21810A542031C02C
        gpg: checking the trustdb
        gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
        gpg: depth: 0  valid:   2  signed:   1  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 2u
        gpg: depth: 1  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 1-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 0u
        gpg: next trustdb check due at 2020-01-12
        gpg: Good signature from "Calin Culianu (NilacTheGrim) <calin.culianu@gmail.com>" [full]
