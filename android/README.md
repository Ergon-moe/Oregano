# Oregano Android app

## Development

To start developing the app, just open this directory in Android Studio.

### Requirements

You'll need to set up the following things before building the app:

* Python must be on the PATH under the name `python3` on Linux/Mac, or `py` on Windows, and it
  must have the packages listed in `build-requirements.txt`.
* The commands `xgettext` and `msgfmt` must be on the PATH. On Windows, the easiest way to
  get these is to install MSYS2.

### Strings

Most user interface strings are reused from the desktop and iOS apps. Android-specific strings
should be added to `app/src/main/python/electroncash_gui/android/strings.py`.

The Gradle task `generateStrings` takes all localized strings in the repository, and their
translations from Crowdin, and converts them into `strings.xml` format so they can be accessed
through the Android resource API. This task is run automatically the first time you build the
app, and whenever you edit the `strings.py` file mentioned above. If you need to pick up new
strings from anywhere else in the repository, run the task `regenerateStrings`.

The Android string IDs are generated from the first 2 words of each string, plus as many more
words as necessary to make them unique. So if any of the source strings change, you may need to
update ID references in the code.

## Release

For public releases, the following reproducible build process can be run on Linux x86-64:

If necessary, install Docker using the [instructions on its
website](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms).

Copy your release key to `keystore.jks` in this directory. It must contain a key with the
following configuration:

    keyAlias "key0"
    keyPassword "android"
    storePassword "android"

Run `build.sh`. The APK will be generated in `release` in this directory.

Between builds it may be helpful to free up disk space with the command `docker system prune`.
